# Riko-WABot

This is an experimental implementation to demonstrate how to use [WhatFramework](https://github.com/kamuridesu/WhatFramework).

# Install

The requirements for stickers are [FFMpeg](https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg) and [libwebp](https://github.com/webmproject/libwebp). You'll also need [NodeJS](https://github.com/nodejs/node) in version >= 16.

You can search on [Google](https://google.com.br) how to install those tools on your system.

After installing all the needed tools, clone this repository with the command `git clone https://github.com/kamuridesu/Riko-WABot.git` and run the following commands:

```sh
npm i --include=dev # Install dependencies
npm run build # Build the project
npx whatframework # Calls the framework runtime
```

And the bot will start.

# Attention
This bot is written in Brazilian Portugueses and I will not translate it to another languages. You can fork and translate it yourself.
